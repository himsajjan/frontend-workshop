  <h1>Lists</h1>

  <p>This is how you make a unordered list</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" elelment (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" (list item) elelment</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order (is IS an UN-ordered list)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything </li>
    <li>But, the list item (li) elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things in this percise order, because it is an ordered list</li>
  </ol>
